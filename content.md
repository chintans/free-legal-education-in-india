**Empower Young Minds with the Power of Law**  
Welcome to the Legal Education Initiative—a unique, non-profit program dedicated to bringing free and engaging legal education to school students (ages 12+) across India. Our mission is simple yet transformative: help young minds understand their rights, appreciate the power of the Indian Constitution, and build a safer, more informed future.

## **Why Legal Education Matters**  
Too often, the law feels out of reach or intimidating, especially for students. We believe that understanding your fundamental rights should be empowering, not daunting. By introducing the basics of constitutional law in an interactive and accessible way, we spark a lifelong awareness that helps students confidently navigate society and become responsible citizens.
